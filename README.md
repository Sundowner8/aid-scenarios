# aid-scenarios
A repository of scenarios for AI Dungeon. Scenarios should be put in their proper categories and have the scenario name in the filename, even with stuff like tags in the filename like: name [tag] [tag].txt

Suggest new categories if you feel none of the current ones fit.

Make a pull request with the scenario(s) you want to add and I'll merge them when I can

Current categories:
- Fantasy
- Science Fiction
- Not safe for work (porn and the like)
- Other (scenarios that doesn't fit into any category)
